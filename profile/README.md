## Exploring Beauty in Sounds

> We are a creative sound-art studio of two people based in 📍Milano, Italy and 📍Hangzhou, China. We create site-specific sound art installations, computational music projects and soundtracks for movies. We express emotions, spatial and geographical data, knowledge and technology into sound art, which is invisible and subtle across different media and forms.
> 
> Our sound artworks derive from applying different methodologies such as field recordings, signal processing, sound synthesis, experimental techniques and instrumental sounds.
> 
> We are and will continue to explore the beauty and meaning that sound can convey. If your project requires music or sound collaboration, we would be happy to discuss it with you.

This is our GitHub home page, where we collect our computational music projects and other experiments.
